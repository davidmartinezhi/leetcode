    bool wordPattern(string pattern, string s) {
        /*
        info
            input: string "pattern" and string "s"
            follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern
            and a non-empty word in "s".

            output: tue if s follows pattern, else false

            conatraints:
                * what range of sizes can the pattern have? [1, 300]
                * what range of sizes can "s" have? [1, 3k]
                * what characters can "s" have? only lowercase english letters
                * does s contain any leading or trailing white space? no
                * are all words in s separated by a single space? yes

        example
            pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
            -> true

            {
                "dog" : "a",
                "cat" : "b"
            }
            {
                "a": "god",
                "b": "cat"
            }

            pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
            -> false

            {
                "dog" : "a",
                "cat" : "b"
            }
            {
                "a": "god",
                "b": "cat"
            }

            pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
            -> false

        brute force
        get all words into an array of words

        example 1
        ["dog", "cat", "cat", "dog"]
        pattern = "abba"

        check if word does not already exists
        check if letter does not already exists

            {
                "dog" : "a",
                "cat": "b"
            }
            {
                "a": "dog",
                "b": "cat"
            }

        example 2
        ["dog", "cat", "cat", "fish"]
        pattern = "abba"

        if they already exists check that there exists bijection 
            word is that letter
            and letter is that word

            else return false

        check if letter does not already exists
            if word exists, return false
            else add word to letter and letter to word

        check if word does not already exists, 
            if letter exists, return false
            else add word to letter and letter to word

        -> false

            {
                "a": "dog",
                "b": "cat"
            }
            {
                "dog": "a",
                "cat": "b"
            }

        complexity: 
            runtime: O(string length + pattern length)
            extra space: O(n*3) -> O(n)

    optimze
        best conceivable runtime: O(patttern length + stringn length)

        I think my algorithm is optimal in runtime, and memory
        because we need to keep track of mapping between words and pattern

    test
        * string matches pattern
        * pattern does not match string
        * pattern of length 0
        * string of length 0

Notes:
    This problem really took me time to decipher and code, it was a long problem 
    in terms of how much I needed to code. I'm glad i got the most optimal solution and
    I recognized I have good reflexes for commenting code and good practces for interview
    coding.

    But It took me a lot of time to come out with the optimal solution, the examples did helped get
    the solution correctly.
