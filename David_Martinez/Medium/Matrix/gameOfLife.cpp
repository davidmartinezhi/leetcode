            have a copy of board for next generation which will be modified based on information 
            on current board.

            complexity:
                runtime: O(n*m)
                extra space: O(n*m)

        optimize
            best conceivable runtime: O(n*m)

            can memory be improved?

I came up with a brute force approach with optimal runtime very quickly
and I believe the solution was displayed since the 20 minutes mark
but i took time on the auxiliary function of getting all the neighbours of a cell

Still it was a very fun problem and I'll try on improving the memory usage
by modifying the board instead of creating a new one.


    // Definir las 8 posibles direcciones: arriba, abajo, izquierda, derecha y las 4 diagonales
    int dx[] = {-1, -1, -1,  0, 0,  1, 1, 1};
    int dy[] = {-1,  0,  1, -1, 1, -1, 0, 1};

    Muy buena idea declarar el traversal como 2 arrays, uno el movimiento en eje x y otro en y
    Buena herramienta para mi kit de soluciones
