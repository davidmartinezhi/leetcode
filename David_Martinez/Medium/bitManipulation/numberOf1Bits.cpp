            output:
                - return number of '1' bits it has

            constraints:
                - input must be a binary string of length 32

        example
            n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
            -> 3

            n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
            -> 32

        brute force solution
            traverse the string once with a pointer and count '1's

            complexity:
                runtime: O(n) -> n = 32 -> O(1)
                extra space: O(1)

        optimize
            best conceivable runtime: O(n) -> O(1)

        test
            - no '1's
            - multiple '1's

        /*
        int count = 0, mask = 1;
        //mask has a 1 in the bit position we are going to check

        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            if((n&mask) != 0) count++;
            mask = mask << 1;
        }
        return count;

        int count = 0;

        while(n != 0){
            n = n&(n-1);
            count++;
        }

        return count;

/*
Time: not taken due to study

complexity naive approach:
    runtime: O(32) -> O(1)
    extra space: O(1)

complexity optimal solution:
    runtime: O('1's present) -> O(1)
    extra space: O(1)

Working with bits is new to me, maybe I should search for tutorials where i can learn
to takle this problems and the common patterns.
