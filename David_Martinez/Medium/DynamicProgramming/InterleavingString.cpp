info
    input: 3 strings (s1,s2,s3)
    output: true/false in case s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2
    constraints:
        strings s1 and s2 have length between 0 and 100
        string 3 has length between 0 and 200
        all strings consist of only lowercase english letters

example
    s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
    -> true

    s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca"
               i            j

    s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
                    k

    s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
    ->false

brute force
    -send recursively to check each index on both string and if they match with that index at s3 and move pointers
    -if one pointer is at the end, just send the pointer of the other string
    -use hashtable and keys for memoization, to avoid unnecessary calculations

    complexity:
        time: O(s1*s2)
        extra space: O(s1*s2*s3)

optimize:
    bcr: O(s1+s2+s3)

    Since we have to work with permutations of combinations from both strings
    recursivity is clear to give an answer

walkthrough

    recursive

        set global ht

        get lengths
        call recursive function with strings, lengths and strting indexes

        base case
        to know if we reached the end
        if(pointer3 == length 3) return (p1 == length 1 && p2 == length 2)

        create key for ht
            check if key already exists
                if it already exists, return it

        check if we have reached the end on only one pointer

        send both pointers to check

        return if any of them is true

test

    empty string
    interleaving is true
    interleaving is false
