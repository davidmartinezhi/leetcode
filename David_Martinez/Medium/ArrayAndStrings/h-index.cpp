                  a researcher has received on the ith paper

            output:
                * researchers h-index

                h-index is the max value of h, such that the given researcher
                has published at least h papers that have each been cited h times

            constraints:
                * what range of sizes can the array have? [1, 5k]
                * what range of values can citation[i] have? [0, 1k]

        example
            citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
            -> 3

            curr = 3
            found = 3
            h = 3
            n = 5

            citations = [1,3,1]
            -> 1

            found = 3
            h = 1
            n = 3



        brute force
            if found equal or more times than current and greater than h
                h equals current

I noticed I've been using the solution flow methodologies instictively now.
I've been applying them without consciously thinking of them. that is good.

Thinking about my solution flow, I think that where I lost time was in the understanfing
of the problem. I didn't understand the problem at first, so I had to read it a couple of times
and I also had to do some tests to know if my understanding of the problem was correct.
